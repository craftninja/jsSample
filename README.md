### Oh Hai

### Running the tests

```sh
yarn test
```

### Run benchmarks

```sh
node benchmark/recursionTests.js
```

### Mess around with functions in the console

Enter the node repl with the shell command `node`
* For exported functions, require the function as follows:

    ```js
    const functionName = require('./lib/functionName');
    functionName(params, and, [more, params]);
    ```

* For exported objects, access the function as follows:

    ```js
    const bundle = require('./lib/bundleFileName');
    bundle.functionName(params, and, [more, params]);
    ```

    OR

    ```js
    const { thing1, thing2 } = require('/lib/thingsFileName');
    thing1(params);
    ```

    OR there are many other ways to import, choose your flavor.

### How this was setup:

1. `$ mkdir whatever` and cd into it
1. `$ yarn init -y` (adds package.json)
1. `$ git init` (adds .git folder and creates repo)
1. `$ yarn add --dev jasmine` (adds jasmine as dev dependency)
1. `$ echo /node_modules >> .gitignore` (avoid committing node modules to repo)
1. `$ yarn run jasmine init`
1. update your package so the test script is `"jasmine"`, in the root of the object:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "test": "jasmine"
    },
    ```

1. `$ yarn test` - the autogenerated json has issues...
1. update `spec/support/jasmine.json` to have a configure key with an object as the value, and move the two configuration settings within the object (`stopSpecOnExpectationFailure` and `random`) to resolve deprication warnings
1. `$ touch spec/main.spec.js` and add the following content:

    ```js
    describe('Jasmine', () => {
      it('is set up in basic repo', () => {
        expect(true).toBe(false);
      });
    });
    ```

1. `$ yarn test`
1. update your tests so they pass and commit

### Adding CircleCI

1. Go to your CircleCI dashboard and add a project, click `Set Up Project`
1. Follow the `Next Steps` to add the `.circleci/config.yml` file and update as necessary
1. Add the node version specified in the config file as a requirement in package.json at the root of the object, perhaps:

    ```json
    "engines": {
      "node": ">=10.12.0"
    },
    ```
